## 1. Overview
GestureGenius revolutionizes human-computer interaction by transforming any standard webcam into a real-time, high-precision virtual cursor. Leveraging OpenCV and Mediapipe, it recognizes dynamic gestures for on-screen actions like clicks, movements, and scrolling, via PyAutoGUI.

This Python-powered system enables touchless control, making it ideal for accessibility, gaming, presentations, and smart environments.

## 2. Features
- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Uses a webcam to detect hand gestures.
- **Real-time Cursor Control**: Maps hand movement to control the cursor and perform clicks and scrolling.
- **No Specialized Hardware**: Runs on standard webcams and common hardware.
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## 3. Motivation
GestureGenius provides a futuristic, hands-free alternative to traditional input devices, enhancing user experiences across various fields like accessibility, gaming, smart home systems, and more.

## 4. Installation

### 4.1 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 4.2 Clone the Repository
To clone the project repository, run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GestureGenius.git
cd GestureGenius
```

### 4.3 Install Required Packages
Install the necessary Python packages using the command below:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, install each package manually:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
```

### 4.4 Hardware Requirements
- **Webcam**: Any standard webcam (built-in or external).
- **Processor**: Intel i3 or higher (i5 or above recommended).
- **RAM**: 4GB or more.
- **Operating System**: Windows, Linux, or macOS.

## 5. Usage

### 5.1 Step 1: Connect Your Webcam
Ensure your webcam is properly connected and functioning.

### 5.2 Step 2: Run the Code
Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run the main Python script:
```bash
python gesturegenius.py
```

### 5.3 Step 3: Interact with Gestures
Once the program is running, it will activate the webcam and display a real-time feed. Use the following gestures:

- **Move Cursor**: Move your hand to control the cursor.
- **Click**: Pinch your fingers together to simulate a mouse click.
- **Scroll**: Swipe up or down for scrolling.

### 5.4 Step 4: Exit the Program
To exit, press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal.

## 6. Methodology

### Hand Detection
The webcam captures video frames, processed by OpenCV to detect the hand.

### Landmark Extraction
Mediapipe identifies 21 key landmarks on the hand, enabling precise tracking.

### Gesture Recognition
Custom algorithms interpret gestures such as pinching for clicks or swiping for scrolling.

### Cursor Mapping
PyAutoGUI translates gestures into on-screen actions like cursor movement, mouse clicks, and scrolling.

## 7. Applications
- **Accessibility**: Provides hands-free control for users with disabilities.
- **Interactive Displays**: Enables gesture-based control for kiosks and public systems.
- **Gaming**: Adds immersive, gesture-based gameplay.
- **Presentations**: Facilitates touch-free navigation during presentations.
- **Automotive Interfaces**: Gesture-based control in vehicles.
- **Smart Home Systems**: Hands-free control of smart home interfaces.

## 8. Future Plans
- **Expand Gesture Set**: Add complex gestures (multi-finger and 3D gestures).
- **Improve Accuracy**: Integrate machine learning to reduce false positives.
- **Cross-Application Support**: Extend compatibility to gaming engines, automotive systems, and smart homes.

## 9. Contributions
We welcome contributions! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or suggest features to enhance GestureGenius.
